# Project Impactive Sleep Tracker App
<!-- ^ is there a more succint name for the app? if yes, please change the name here, in all the documentation files, and in the app itself -->

A Flutter-based sleep tracking app designed for monitoring sleep patterns, logging daily activities (such as caffeine intake, exercise, medication), analyzing correlations between activities and sleep quality, and exporting data for further analysis.

This project was developed as part of [Project Impactive](https://studentsunionucl.org/volunteering/organisation/project-impactive) and was co-created to meet the requirements of an individual with a circadian rhythm disorder, providing a tool to monitor sleep patterns beyond a paper sleep diary.

This project will no longer actively be worked on from 19/01/2026, but can be used, distributed, adapted, and built upon under the terms of the [GPLv3 Licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html#license-text) (LICENSE).
