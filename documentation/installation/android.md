# Installation guide (for Android users)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to manually install (sideload) the application on an Android device using the `.apk` file.

## 1. How to Download

1.  Navigate to the **Releases** section of this repository (usually found on the right-hand sidebar of the main page).
2.  Find the version tagged **Latest**.
3.  Under the **Assets** dropdown menu, click on the file named `app-release.apk` to download it to your device.
    * *If you are downloading on a computer:* Transfer the file to your phone via USB, Google Drive, or WhatsApp.
    * *If you are downloading on your phone:* The file will appear in your **Downloads** folder.

## 2. How to Install

1.  Open your phone's **Files** app.
2.  Locate the downloaded `.apk` file.
3.  Tap the file to open it.

### Handling Security Prompts
Depending on your Android version, you may see a security popup:

* **"For your security, your phone is not allowed to install unknown apps from this source."**
    * Tap **Settings** on the popup.
    * Toggle **ON** the switch that says *"Allow from this source"* 
    * Go back and tap the APK file again.

* **Google Play Protect Warning ("Unsafe App Blocked")**
    * Because this app is in development and not on the Play Store, Google may flag it.
    * Tap **More Details** (or the arrow icon).
    * Select **Install Anyway**.

4.  Tap **Install** and wait for the process to finish.
5.  Tap **Open** to launch the app!

## 3. How to Update

When a new version of the app is released, you do **not** need to delete the current app.

1.  Download the new `.apk` file following the steps in Section 1.
2.  Tap the new file to install it.
3.  Your phone will ask: *"Do you want to install an update to this existing application?"*
4.  Tap **Update**.

> **Important:** Using the "Update" button preserves your login data and settings. If you uninstall the app first, you will lose your saved local data.

## Troubleshooting

| Error Message | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"App not installed"** | This usually happens if you try to install an older version over a newer one. Ensure you are installing the latest release. |
| **"Parse Error"** | The APK file might be corrupted during download. Delete the file and download it again. |
| **"Package appears to be corrupt"** | This may happen if the APK was sent via an app that compresses files. Try downloading it directly from the link or via Google Drive. |
