# Sleep Tracking and Editing

The sleep tracking feature allows users to record detailed sleep data, while the editing functionality enables modification of past entries for accuracy.

## Sleep Tracking

Users can log four key time points for each sleep session:

- **Bed Time**: The time the user gets into bed
- **Asleep Time**: The time the user falls asleep
- **Wake Time**: The time the user wakes up
- **Rise Time**: The time the user gets out of bed

Additionally, the user can add the **number of awakenings** and **estimated total time awake** for these. This is useful for a user who has many awakenings per night but does not keep track of exactly when they occur.

This detailed tracking helps calculate sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and identify patterns in sleep cycles.

## Editing Past Entries

The app provides a calendar view where users can:

- Select any past date to view or edit sleep data
- Modify existing sleep and activity entries
- Add missing sleep data for previous days
- Ensure data accuracy over time

This leads to the [events page](/documentation/features/events.md) for the selected day.

## Data Validation

The app includes validation to ensure logical time sequences (e.g. bed time before asleep time, wake time before rise time), preventing invalid data entry.
